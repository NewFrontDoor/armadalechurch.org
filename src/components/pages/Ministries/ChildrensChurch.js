                          <h4>Our children’s program runs during the Sunday morning service. Before the main talk it will be announced when children aged 3-12 are welcome to go out to engage in their dedicated program, which lasts for about 40 minutes (until the formal part of the service finishes). Moira is our children’s co-ordinator, but others assist in this important ministry. All our children’s workers have current Children’s Checks, parents are welcome to come and see what activities kids get up to, and Moira is always happy to chat about the curriculum.</h4>
                          <h4>No prior knowledge is assumed – kids come from all sorts of backgrounds and learning levels.</h4>

                          <p className="subtext">People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. (Mark 10:13-16)</p>
